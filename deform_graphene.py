        - This is a helper function for 'self.add_neighbors()'.
        - This function finds the neighbors of an atom based on the atom id, whether there be one, two, or three neighbors.
        - This algorithm relies on the specific algorithm used to create the graphene sheet and assign the atom ids that
        is used in create_graphene.py. This will not work if the graphene sheet is not setup with that atomid format. 

        Parameters:
            - id (int): This is the atom id of the atom in question, which is the one we want to find the neighbors of. 

        Returns:
            - neighbors (np.array[int]): This is a list of all of the neighbors for that atom id. This could either be of length 
            1, 2, or 3 depending on where the original atom is situated (and if any of the neighbors had already been removed)
