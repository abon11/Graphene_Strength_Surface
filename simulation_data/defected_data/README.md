# This dataset includes...

## 60x60 Sheets:
    *Note that the angled states of stress are wrong - they do not provide the full strength surface.*
    - Pristine sheet at theta=0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 29, 30, 90 
    - SV defects 1%, 2% with random seeds 1-9, 42 at theta=0 and theta=90
    - SV defects 0.5% random seeds 1-13, 42 at theta=0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 29, 90
    - SV defects 0.5% random seeds 14-24 at theta=0, 15, 30
    - Running: SV defects 0.5% for random seeds 25-100 at theta=0.

## 100x100 Sheets:
    - SV defects 0.5%, 1%, 2% with random seeds 1-9, 42 at theta=0 and theta=30
